# Readme Generator

### Module 9 Challenge

A simple markdown generator for the README.md written in node.js for the CLI using inquirer and file system.

## This is still a Work In Progress.


### Asignment Requirements

- Create a command line application that takes user input and generates a README.md file.

- When the application is ran it should prompt the user for information about their project including the title of their project, description of the project, installation process, usage, contribution guidelines, and license of the project.

- The table of contents should have working links to each of the sections of the README.md file.

- When choosing a license a list should be shown of all the licenses available.

- The application should select a badge from Shields.io to display on the README.md file for the license chosen.

- When the user enters their GitHub username it should be displayed in the questions section of the README.md file.

- When the user enters their email it should be displayed in the questions section of the README.md file.

### Current status:

- The application is partially working as some errors are present during the question prompts which prevents the application from generating the README.md file.

- Some questions are missing from the prompts this is non-breaking but does not meet all of the assignment requirements. The missing questions will be addressed in the future.

- The application will not run as a normal .js file. It will however run when the file extensions are changed to .mjs. This is one of the bugs that I am working on.

- The application will create an output directory but does not make it far enough without errors to create the actual readme.md file in the output folder. This is one of the bugs that I am working on.

### Future plans (not in any order):

- Automatically detect the technologies used and generate badges to include in the README.md file.

- Create a batch file to run the application automatically.

- Additional markdown formatting to include the ability to add screenshots to the README.md file.

- Add tests to the application to ensure that it is working as intended.

- Add a feature to create project folders for each of the readme files.
